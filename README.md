Hi, I’m Alan Monti

Backend & Data-Driven Systems Specialist

I design and build reliable business systems where logic, payments, and data integrity truly matter.

My focus is not just developing features — but creating structured architectures that generate decision-ready data and support long-term business growth.

Complex business rules

Financial workflows & payment processing

Structured database design

Reporting-ready architectures

Data modeling and analytics

Core Stack
Backend

MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server

REST APIs & JWT integrations

Complex validation and financial logic

Frontend

SQL-based reporting

ETL and structured datasets

What I Build

Business management systems (sales, payments, account flows)

Data-driven tools for decision-making

Automation and ETL workflows

My Approach

I don’t just write code.

I design systems where:
